# Project: ES6 and Unit Tests 🧪🔬

This project was developed as part of the Trybe Web Development course, where I implemented various functions and unit tests to guarantee the reliability of the code. The project focused on the following objectives:

- Writing unit tests using NodeJS's Jest module to verify the proper functioning of the functions.
- Implementing functions that satisfy the provided tests.
- Adopting a test-driven development (TDD) methodology.

### ⚠️  This repository does not include all the function and tests files present in the original project since the tool used to make the copy from the original repository ommit and/or modify some of the files in order to comply with copyright restrictions.
