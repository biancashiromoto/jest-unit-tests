# Project: ES6 and Unit Tests

This project was developed as part of the Trybe Web Development course, where I implemented various functions and unit tests to guarantee the reliability of the code. The project focused on the following objectives:
<li>Writing unit tests using NodeJS's Jest module to verify the proper functioning of the functions.</li>
<li>Implementing functions that satisfy the provided tests.</li>
<li>Adopting a test-driven development (TDD) methodology.</li>
